### Props

| Prop        | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src`       | string | *required*| The URL of the image.                                                                    |
| `alt`       | string | `"Image"`|  Alternative text for the image (for accessibility).                                      |
| `fallbackSrc` | string | *none*  | URL of the image to display if the main `src` image fails to load.                        |
| `lazy`      | boolean| `true` |  Enables or disables lazy loading.                                                         |
| `className` | string | `""`    |  CSS class name to apply to the image.                                                    |
| `style`     | object | `{}`    |  Inline styles to apply to the image.                                                       |
| `placeholder` | React.ReactNode | `null` |  A React node (e.g., a component, text, or an image) to display while the image is loading.|

### Fallback Image

If the `src` image fails to load and no `fallbackSrc` is provided, the component will display a default placeholder image.

### Placeholder Content

The `placeholder` prop allows you to display custom content while the image is loading. This can be a loading spinner, a blurred version of the image, or any other React node.

### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is enabled by default, which improves performance by only loading images when they are visible in the viewport. You can disable lazy loading by setting the `lazy` prop to `false`.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the image using CSS classes and inline styles.  The `className` prop allows you to apply CSS rules defined in your stylesheets, while the `style` prop allows you to set inline styles directly.
